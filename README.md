### Password Generator Starter Code

## TO DO:

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Pseudocode:

1. I have no idea where to start with this 

when generate button is clicked we want user to be able to generate a password based on criteria they have chosen.

So user should be able to choose from options I give.
Ex: 

prompt= How long do you want your password to be? Choose a number between 8 to 128 characters?

prompt= What would you like to include in your password? select 1 for upper case and 2 for lower case letters 3 for both.

prompt= would you like to include any numbers? yes or no

prompt= would you like to include any special characters? yes or no?
